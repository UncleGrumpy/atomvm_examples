# `wifi` Application

Welcome to the `wifi` AtomVM application.

The `wifi` AtomVM application demonstrates how to configure an ESP32 device for both Station (STA) and Access Point (AP) modes, allowing an ESP32 device to join an existing WiFi network or to serve as a WiFi access point for other devices.
