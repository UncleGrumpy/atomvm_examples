# AtomVM Example Programs

Welcome to the AtomVM Example programs.

This repository contains a collection of self-contained example programs demonstrate features of the [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM) Virtual Machine.

Each example in this repository represents a self-contained AtomVM "application", which can be built and executed by the AtomVM virtual machine using a minimal set of tooling and to get you up to speed as quickly as possible.

> Note. The example applications in this repository are written for demonstration purposes only and may take short-cuts when it comes to error checking, performance, and beauty.  Use your best judgement about how to integrate these example programs into your applications.
