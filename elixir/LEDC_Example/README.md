# `LEDC_Example` Application

Welcome to the `LEDC_Example` AtomVM application.

The `LEDC_Example` AtomVM application illustrates use of the AtomVM `LEDC` interface.

LEDs are wired to GPIO pins 4, 5, 18, and 19 and should use a resistor (minimum 100 Ohm up to 1K, 220 Ohm is a good choice). Change the number
for the GPIO pins in the example if necessary. See the Blinky example for wiring if you are unsure.

For more information about programming on the AtomVM platform, see the [AtomVM Programmers Guide](https://doc.atomvm.net/programmers-guide.html).

For general information about building and executing Erlang AtomVM example programs, see the Erlang example program [README](../README.md).
