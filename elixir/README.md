# AtomVM Elixir Example Programs

Welcome to the AtomVM Elixir Example programs.

The applications in this directory make use of the [AtomVM Mix Plugin](https://github.com/atomvm/ExAtomVM) to compile, assemble, and if applicable, flash the application onto an ESP32 device.

For each example in this directory, change your working directory to the corresponding example program, and execute the instructions in the `README.md` in each example.
